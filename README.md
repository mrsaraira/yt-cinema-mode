## Cinema mode enlarges the player in youtube's theater mode + Tampermonkey script

When in theater mode, the video now takes up the entire viewport height and viewport width and the search bar is hidden. This way, the tabs are still visible and system information like the clock can be seen at a glance. When the mouse hovers over the area where the search bar used to be, it slides down and works like usual.

On the YouTube homepage, the search bar is always shown.

(Chromium only:)
On scroll, the search bar also slides down to be visible.
